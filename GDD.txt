Game Design Outline: Project Narco-Syndicate (Version 3.14)
(Working Title - User to select final title; alternatives: Global Hustle, Zero Sum Trader, BitCartel, Shadow Ledger)
Core Concept & Elevator Pitch:
Concept: An "Enhanced Drug Wars" for PC that blends classic buy-low, sell-high drug trading with modern strategic layers including a dynamic cryptocurrency market (staking, laundering), a rich event system (high-risk deals, rival busts), meaningful player progression (skills, upgrades for OpSec), impactful risk management, and contact-based services.
Elevator Pitch: Rise from a small-time dealer burdened by debt to a criminal kingpin. Juggle drug trade risks with volatile crypto (stake DC, launder cash!), manage your heat with skills like "Digital Footprint" or a "Secure Phone", navigate contacts, rivals (who can get busted!), and law enforcement. Take on risky "Setup" deals. Access the exclusive Crypto-Only Shop. Every choice has a consequence. Gameplay depth over graphical fidelity.
